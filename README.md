# EE120A
Hello and welcome to my repository for EE120A-Logic Design! This is just a 
compilation of my work in this class. We used the Basys Spartan3E FPGA for this 
class and programmed in Verilog/VHDL using the Xilinx ISE. Uploaded here are 
various labs that I have done utilizing this software and hardware to create
parts like muxes, adders, etc.
